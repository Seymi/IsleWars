                             * Objective *

           The object of Isle Wars is to conquer all nine islands
      with your armies.  You play the Blue army and the computer
      plays the other three adversaries, the Green, Red and Brown.

           Isle Wars is totally Mouse controlled, so you will never need
      to touch the keyboard. Isle Wars is quite simple to learn and offers
      different levels of play.  The game rules are very similar to the
      classic game of 'Risk', however, there are many other elements that
      you will have to contend with in order to conquer all nine islands.



                      * To Play / Setting Levels *

           At the opening screen, the game will ask you at what level
      of difficulty you would like to play.  This setting will now
      become the default for future games.  The difficulty level is
      determined by how many starting countries you occupy at the start
      of the game.

          The difficulty levels are:  1 = Easy to 4 = Hardest. You then
      set the number of armies that are possible in each country at the
      start of the game.  The maximum is 10 the minimum is 1.

           If you want to continue a game previously saved, here is where
      you have the opportunity to reload it, and resume play.



                           * Getting Armies *

          The game randomly decides who will take the first turn. At the
      beginning of each turn, you are given armies for the number of
      countries you occupy.  That number is divided by 3 and gives you
      that number of armies to place onto the board.  Each island gives
      you extra armies if you totally control all its grids.

      The island values are shown below.

                       2
                   8
              2  4  3    5
                4   5
                       2



                           * Placing Armies *

           You will be shown the number of armies you have received for
      that turn (minimum is 2).  The computer will ask you to select the
      destination city.  This is the number in the black box located
      in each country.  Click the left button on the city number where you
      want to place your armies.  You will see the city number displayed
      on the bottom left of the screen.  If this is the right location,
      click the right button. The computer will now ask you how many
      armies you want placed there.  The number below the City number is
      the number of troops you have presently in that grid. At the placement
      window (bottom of screen) are three buttons (ALL)  (OTHER)  (DONE).
      If you want to place all your troops in the country you selected,
      click on (ALL). If you want to place some of the troops in the
      country, click on (OTHER).

          If you have selected (OTHER), click the Left button to add troops
      one at a time or right button to subtract by one.  Your total troop
      deployment will be shown above the cursor.  When you have set the
      proper number, click on the (DONE) key. This continues until all the
      armies you have been given for that turn are placed onto the board.

          The game will prompt you with all the instructions, so don't
      worry. It's quite easy once you get the hang of it.


                                * Attacking *

           Once you have placed all your armies, new buttons will be
      displayed at the bottom.

                (ATTACK)  (MOVE)  (PASS)  (CARDS)  (CANCEL)

          To attack another grid, it must be adjacent to the grid you're
      attacking from.  There are lines from island to island that allow
      you to travel across the water (in ships) to a attack other islands.
      You can only attack another grid if your total number of armies in
      that grid is to equal or greater than the number you're attacking.

           Click the mouse on (ATTACK) and the computer will ask you
      to select the territory you want to attack.  Click the left button
      on the territory.  When that territory number is displayed on the
      bottom left, select the territory you want to attack from.
      Remember you are playing the BLUE army.

           The computer then rolls dice (not shown) to decide the
      outcome.  If the attacking army has a higher number than the
      defending army, then one army will be subtracted from the defending
      city; the opposite is true if the attacking army loses.  A tie
      will count as a loss for the attacking army because the defending
      city carries the advantage.  At higher levels of army concentrations
      like 300 against 200, the computer will speed up play by rolling
      about 25 times before asking you whether you want to attack again.

      There are two buttons which are shown while attacking:

                        (ATTACK)  (QUIT-ATTACK)

          Keep clicking on (ATTACK) if you want to continue attacking.
      If you want to call off the attack, click the (QUIT-ATTACK) button.
      If your attacking army ever gets down to 1, then you will forfeit
      not only the turn, but also the grid to the defending army.  That
      means if you have 2 troops left and are attacking an opposing grid
      with 1 and you lose, it now becomes occupied by your enemy. Play
      then passes to the computer.

           If you can deplete the enemy to 0 armies, the computer will
      ask you how many troops you want to move into the grid.  Select the
      number as you do when you deploy your troops.  The only stipulation
      is that you have to move at least one army into the conquered grid.
           You can then continue to attack, etc... until you decide to
      finish your turn by pressing, either the (MOVE) button or the (PASS)
      button.


                              * Move Armies *

          At the end of each turn, you are allowed to move troops between
      two adjacent countries.  Click on the (MOVE) button and select the
      two countries (BLUE). Then the computer will ask you to select the
      number of troops to move. Use the select number panel as you would
      when placing armies.  After your move is complete, play will then
      pass to the computer.


                                 * Pass *

          If you do not want to move armies, simply press the (PASS) button
      to indicate your turn is over.


                                * Cancel *

          Press this button if you change your mind on an attack, move,
      etc...  Sometimes the computer will get confused as to where?
      and from?  because you clicked several different countries.
      Just press (CANCEL) button and try again.


                                * Cards *

          If during your turn, you defeated an opposing army, you will
      be given a card displayed on the bottom of the screen.  These cards
      are for various Bonus Armies, Bombs, Air Moves, etc... The CARD button
      at the bottom shows you what cards you presently have in your hand.


                              * Card List *

      Air Move:            Allows movement from any country to
                           any other country (of your color).

      5/8/15 Bonus Armies: Adds this many armies to your total
                           at the beginning of your turn.

      Double:              This card doubles your placement
                           total at the start of your turn.

      Bomb:                Allows you to bomb any country.
                           The effects of the bomb will be
                           shown in the new value of troops
                           shown in that opposing country.

      Anti-Bomb:           This protects you from a bomb drop
                           on your own countries from the
                           other computer players. If you have
                           only one Anti-Bomb card in your
                           hand, it will protect you from an
                           opposing bomb.  If used it will be
                           eliminated from your hand
                           automatically.  Don't trade in 3
                           sets of Anti-Bombs, it gives you
                           nothing.  If you have more than 1
                           Anti-Bomb card and it is used to
                           protect you, all the Anti-Bomb cards
                           will be taken from your hand.  Therefore,
                           you'll only need to collect one of
                           them.

      Lose All Cards:      If you draw this card, your
                           cards are all taken away.

      Wild Card:           Matches any other card.



                            * Trade In Cards *

           To Trade in cards, the computer will inform you automatically
      at the start of your turn whether or not you have a match.  A match
      is 3 cards that are the same.

      For example:     8 Bonus / 8 Bonus / 8 Bonus

                    or 8 Bonus / Wild / 8 Bonus

                    or Wild / Wild / 8 Bonus

                    (3 wild cards are not a match)

           If you have a set, they must be exchanged at the
      top of your turn.  You will only have one opportunity to
      decide if this is what you want.  The computer will show
      your cards and ask you to click LFT for trade, RGT for no
      trade.

           If you select Trade with LFT click, then you carefully
      select the three cards you want by clicking on top of them.
      If you make a mistake you CANNOT reverse your decision.  If
      you selected three cards that don't make a set, the computer
      assumes you don't want to trade in cards, and will start your
      play.  If your 3 selections makes a set, the computer will
      adjust your troop deployment totals accordingly or for a bomb set,
      ask what country...etc...

           You can only hold 5 cards in your hand at once.  If you have
      more than 5, the computer will ask you which card you want to
      discard.  Click on the card to eliminate and make room for your
      new card.



              * Situations / Disasters / Production Centers *

           At various times during the game, certain events will occur.
      These will have a dramatic impact on the game play.  These events
      are random and you cannot predict them.

      They are as follows:


      1 = An Earthquake has hit the Islands  (3 or 4 grids).
      2 = Flooding has inundated some grids  (3 or 4 grids).
      3 = A rebellion has occurred in one of the countries.
      4 = Rebels have taken control from an opposing army. The
          grid changes hands.
      5 = Production Center increase.  All armies located on
          the Production Centers indicated by a (*) below
          the City number will be doubled!

           If the message is one of the first four, Hold On!, it
      could hit in grids that you occupy.  The computer will
      indicate which grids are hit and some men will be
      deducted from their total.

           If it says Production Center Increase and you happen to
      occupy a grid with a (*) in it, your number of armies
      will double in that grid, of course that goes for your opponents
      as well.



                             * End Of Game *

          If you are eliminated from the game board by the computer's
      other armies, you will be shown a special menu that will allow
      you to concede that game and play another one.  The score will be
      recorded as a loss on that level.  You can also have the computer
      play the game out to find out who will eventually be the victor.
      The computer will play at a very fast pace.  Every 20 moves it will
      ask you again whether you want it to continue play or to begin a
      new game.

          If you are the victor, the game will end and your score totals
      will be shown.



                            * Option Buttons *

          Every time your turn comes around, special Option Buttons will
      appear at the top left of your screen.

                  (SOUND) (SCORES) (SPEED) (SAVE) (QUIT)

                  Sound : Toggles sound on and off
                  Scores: Shows Isle War Score Board
                  Speed : Increase speed of play
                          (1-9) 1=fast  9=very slow

           I like speed set at 1 so I can play my turn faster each time.
       However, you won't be able to figure out the computers strategy as
       easily because it moves too fast!!

       (Save) :      At the beginning of your turn (BEFORE YOU PLACE
                  YOUR ARMIES), you will have the opportunity to
                  save the game board at this point.  When you
                  begin a new game or reload the game, you can
                  reload the game and continue on where you
                  last left off. Only one game can be saved in the
                  computers memory, so the game last saved will be
                  the one reloaded when this feature is invoked.

       (Quit) :      You can quit the game at any time and begin a new
                  one when it is your turn to play. However, if you are
                  not ahead at the time you decide to quit, your score WILL
                  be recorded as a LOSS at that level. If you have 30 or
                  more countries it will be considered a win at that level.
                  Less than 30 is a loss!


                               * Conclusion *


           The best way to learn is to just begin to play. It takes only
      a few minutes to master the commands but it will take hours to
      learn the best strategies to defeat your opponents.  Games average
      from 8 to 45 minutes (I've had one last 4 hours!) depending on your
      speed level.
